    "Experience replay stores the agent's experiences in memory. Batches of experiences are randomly sampled from memory and are used to train the neural network. Such learning consists of two phases--gaining experience and updating the model. The size of the replay controls the number of experiences that are used for the network update. Memory is an array that stores the agent's state, reward, and action, as well as whether the action finished the game and the next state.\n",

    "Traditional Deep Q Learning tends to overestimate the reward, which leads to unstable training and lower quality policy. Let's consider the equation for the Q value:\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "The last part of the equation takes the estimate of the maximum value. This procedure results in systematic overestimation, which introduces a maximization bias. Since Q-learning involves learning estimates from estimates, such overestimation is especially worrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid such a situation, I will define a new target network. The Q values will be taken from this new network, which is meant to reflect the state of the main DQN. However, it doesn't have identical weights because it's only updated after a certain number of episodes. This idea has been first introduced in Hasselt et al., 2015.\n",
    "The addition of the target network might slow down the training since the target network is not continuously updated. However, it should have a more robust performance over time.\n",
